# üè¶ Overview
This project simulates a complete banking system database pipeline built from scratch, covering all key stages from design to reporting. It includes:

-Database Design using Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) and mapping
-Data generation to simulate real-world banking operations
-SQL scripts to create the database, insert data, and define stored procedures
-Data modeling using Power Query to clean and structure the data
-Business Intelligence dashboards developed in Power BI for customer insights and financial metrics
-Reporting using SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to deliver formatted reports
-Full documentation of all project steps and decisions

The goal of the project is to demonstrate an end-to-end data workflow using modern tools, reflecting real-life scenarios in the retail banking sector.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This project showcases a full data lifecycle for a simulated banking system ‚Äî from database design and implementation to advanced reporting and business intelligence.
It highlights my ability to integrate multiple tools and technologies (SQL, Power BI, SSRS, Power Query) to solve real-world data challenges. I developed this project
independently from scratch to strengthen my technical skills and demonstrate my readiness for a data-focused role in the financial industry.
